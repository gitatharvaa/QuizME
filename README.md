# QuizMe
QuizMe is a robust Android application built using modern technologies and best practices. It allows users to participate in quizzes, test their knowledge, and have an engaging experience. 
Let’s dive into the technical details:


## Features

*Jetpack Compose UI*: We’ve leveraged Jetpack Compose to create a beautiful and responsive user interface. Compose’s declarative approach simplifies UI development.

*Clean Architecture*: Our app follows a clean architecture approach, separating concerns into three layers: data, domain, and presentation (UI). This promotes maintainability and scalability.

*Dependency Injection with Hilt*: Hilt handles dependency injection seamlessly, making our codebase modular and testable.

*ViewModel for State Management*: Jetpack’s ViewModel manages the app’s state efficiently, ensuring a smooth user experience.

*API Integration with Retrofit*: We’ve integrated external APIs using Retrofit, simplifying API requests and responses.

*JSON Serialization with Gson*: Gson efficiently handles JSON serialization and deserialization.
